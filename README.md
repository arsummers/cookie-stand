for codefellows 201d45 salmon cookies project

The code for branches 1 and 2 comes from following along in Nicholas Carignan's class, since I had fallen behind in the labs and didn't have enough to work on before hand.

Have had lots of help getting javascript to work right, but I still don't have my form filling out new instances of Salmon Cookies like I want it to.

The wireframe I started with was adapted from one we all built together in class, but it has now taken a life of its own, with more randonly placed salmon.

My random number generators are working perfectly. Once I have my form working how it should, this page will be complete, but I'm worried I might have to revamp a lot of code further up to get them to interact right, and I don't currently have enough time for that right now.
